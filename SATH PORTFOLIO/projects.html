                <h2>Snake Game in Java</h2>
                <p>I developed a classic Snake Game using Java and IntelliJ IDEA. This project features a fully functional snake that moves and grows by eating apples, with a scoring system to track the player's progress. Additionally, I enhanced the game's visuals by adding eyes to the snake. This project honed my skills in Java programming, particularly in using javax.swing for graphics and implementing game logic.</p>
            <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
            <p> I designed and developed a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This responsive and visually appealing website showcases my skills, projects, and professional journey. The site features a clean and modern design, easy navigation, and dynamic elements to enhance user experience. Through this project, I improved my web development skills and gained hands-on experience in creating a polished portfolio. </p>
